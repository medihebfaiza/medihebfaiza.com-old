## Description

Commanant is a Alexa skill that we developed during our 5th year of Coputer science and management and that was our entry for the Alexa Skill Challenge 2018 in France.

This skill allows users to manage their files, folders and git repositories only by voice commands and It works by allowing a secure connection between the device and the user's system in order to control it.

In the meantime there are only some simple commands that can be used but hope to develop more this project and to make it available to the public users.
