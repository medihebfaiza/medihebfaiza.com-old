## Description

As part of my fourth year of Computer Science and Management engineering degree at Polytech Montpellier, I worked with one of my classmates for an Internship at [Octipas][octipas-site].

During this Internship, we were able to focus on the Digital Sales Assistant Solution created by the company and be part of a feature development project for this solution. The solution aims to digitize the point of sale by offering the sellers a variety of rich features that facilitates their job and improves the customer experience such as direct access to product information and the making of payments directly on a handheld device.

Our mission was to create a Data Synchronization Mechanism between two platforms that are Prestashop which manages e-commerce and Odoo which manages in-store sales and integrates the Digital Sales Assistant Solution.

The results of this project are a functional connector module for each platform and an API that interconnects the two platforms with each other.
