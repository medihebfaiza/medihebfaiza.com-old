As part of our 4th year in engineering school, we had to implement our first iOS application with Swift language.

This application was created to help patients with Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the application allows users to :
- Manage medical appointments
- Plan exercises
- Receive alerts when an exercise must be performed, with its description
- See the prescribed pills
- Receive an alarm when a pill has to be taken
