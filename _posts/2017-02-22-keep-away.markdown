## Description

Keep Away is a simple security device that helps protect objects in museums which visitors are not allowed to touch.

## How it works

* Keep Away warns the visitors by telling them to keep a safe distance.

* If a visitor doesn't respect the safety distance, Keep Away captures a photo of the visitor and sends it to the security guard.

* Finally, the security guard checks if the object was harmed by the visitor.
