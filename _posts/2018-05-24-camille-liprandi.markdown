## Description

As part of our 4th year industrial project, we chose Ms [Camille Liprandi][site]â€™s offer that was initially to create web-responsive application allowing her to run her appointments for her office. 

We wanted to be sure the application would be fully customised. After a technological surveillance, we decided to go with a full stack JavaScript application. We took our inspiration from the website Ms Liprandi had already created with the Wix.com platform for our applicationâ€™s graphic content and structure.

The result of this project is a web-responsive, functional and hosted application. This project was a positive experience that allowed us to improve our skills and self-confidence.
