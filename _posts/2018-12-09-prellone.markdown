## Description

As part of a project in fifth year engineering school, we had to create an application in the course Web Application and Interoperability.
This app is called Prello, it is a project management tool inspired by Trello. We had to implement the main features of the Trello application but we also had to implement:
- An Oauth2 server that is a protocol allowing third-party applications to access certain private resources of our API.
- A login with LDAP allowing Polytech Montpellier users to connect with their Polytech credentials.

## Technologies 

We made this project with a SOFEA architecture and we used the following technologies:
