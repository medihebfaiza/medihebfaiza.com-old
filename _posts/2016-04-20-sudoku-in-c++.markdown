## Description

This was a group project that I worked on with two of my colleagues during the second year of bachelor's degree at the University of Montpellier.
The goal was to make a Sudoku game that can generate playable Sudoku grids and help the players solve them.

My main task was to write the algorithms of the game for generating and solving the sudoku grids which are based on the backtracking method, but I also worked with the code that was written in C++ and Qt.

This program allows users to :
- Generate a playable Sudoku grid with the size and difficulty level of choice
- Help the player solve the grid
- Verify the player's input
- Save and load games
