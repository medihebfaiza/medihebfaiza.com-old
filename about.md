Hi, My name is Mohamed Iheb Faiza and I'm a Computer Science and Management 
  Engineering Student at Polytech Montpellier, France.
  I love Software Engineering a lot but I'm also very interested in Design, 
  Photography and Video/Photo Editing.
  I'm currently in the last year of my engineering curriculum. 
  I have gained a lot of technical and functional skills during my engineering training 
  (that you can find outlined on my portfolio) but I am highly motivated and willing to continue 
  developing my skills after my graduation.
  College ends learning doesn't.
