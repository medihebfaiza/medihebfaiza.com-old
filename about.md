Hi, I'm a Computer Science and Management Engineer working at [Capgemini TS](https://www.capgemini.com/). I graduated from [Polytech Montpellier](https://www.polytech.umontpellier.fr/), France.

I love Software Engineering and Web developement but I'm also very interested in Design, Photography and Video/Photo Editing.

In this portfolio/blog website you'll find some of the projects that I have worked on. I'm currently working on some side projects that I will be sharing on this website. My goal is to keep learn new skills after graduation.

College ends learning doesn't.
