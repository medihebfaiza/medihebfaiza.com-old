  As part of my fourth year of Computer Science and Management engineering degree at Polytech Montpellier, I worked with one of my classmates for an Internship at Octipas.
  During this Internship, we were able to focus on the Digital Sales Assistant Solution created by the company and be part of a feature development project for this solution. The solution aims to digitize the point of sale by offering the sellers a variety of rich features that facilitates their job and improves the customer experience such as direct access to product information and the making of payments directly on a handheld device.
  Our mission was to create a Data Synchronization Mechanism between two platforms that are Prestashop which manages e-commerce and Odoo which manages in-store sales and integrates the Digital Sales Assistant Solution.
  The results of this project are a functional connector module for each platform and an API that interconnects the two platforms with each other.
